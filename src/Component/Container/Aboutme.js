        I'm a Full stack for both web and mobile application Developer. From
        being an Intern to full time was not a easy job for me as i joined the
        organization with zero knowledge on development. Gradually as the days
        passed i becoming more strong and confident on the technical skills
        following my mentor advice ,got help and support from colleague initial
        and worked hard for the achievement. Presently i am working client
        project at Nineleaps and having learned some of the tech
        stack,developing application,testing and deploying it from my internship
        projects and some from my personal poc i am willing to learn and explore
        more in the same field.
